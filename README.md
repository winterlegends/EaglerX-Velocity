## Known Issues
											
- [EagProxyAAS] Player is missing skin when connected to server
  - Due to Eaglercraft's skin system and how it works, forcing skins onto the client is not possible at this moment. <br>This is only a client-sided bug/glitch and others will only see your Mojang/Minecraft account skin and cape.

## Installing and Running

First, run `sh install.sh` in the terminal, which will install all modules.
then just run `sh startup.sh` in terminal, that will run all of the necessary
commands needed to be ran for the program to function properly.

## Plugins

As of right now, I've currently disabled this feature due to work in progress of it in my local repository.
<br>*Stay tuned.*

## Reporting Issues

**NOTE:** This project is used mainly for a Minecraft Network called WinterLegends, asking for help on this with the Owners of the project (ignCeltic) will not help at all since they likely wont help unless they know you. Thank you.
