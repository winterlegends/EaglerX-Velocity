## Known Issues
											
- [EagProxyAAS] Player is missing skin when connected to server
  - Due to Eaglercraft's skin system and how it works, forcing skins onto the client is not possible at this moment. <br>This is only a client-sided bug/glitch and others will only see your Mojang/Minecraft account skin and cape.

## Installing and Running

First, run `sh install.sh` in the terminal, which will install all modules.
then just run `sh startup.sh` in terminal, that will run all of the necessary
commands needed to be ran for the program to function properly.

## Plugins

As of right now, I've currently disabled this feature due to work in progress of it in my local repository.
<br>*Stay tuned.*
